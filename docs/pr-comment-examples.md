## Benefits of Combined Metrics

The combined PR comment provides valuable insights:

1. **Development Planning**: Size indicates review complexity and time requirements
2. **Code Quality**: Maturity reflects preparation quality and development practices
3. **Process Improvement**: Low maturity scores can indicate areas for developer coaching
4. **Team Metrics**: Track improvements in both size management and code stability over time

## Customization

The comment format and thresholds can be customized by:
- Modifying the emoji mappings in `getMaturityEmoji()` and `getSizeEmoji()`
- Adjusting the maturity level descriptions in `getMaturityLevel()`
- Updating the PR size thresholds in the categorization logic
- Customizing the comment template in the `addPRComment()` method
