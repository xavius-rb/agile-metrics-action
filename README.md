A GitHub Action that collects key agile and DevOps metrics from your repository,
including:

**DORA Metrics:**

- **Deployment Frequency**: How often deployments are made to production
- **Lead Time for Change**: Time from commit to deployment

**DevEx Metrics:**

- **PR Size**: Automatic categorization of pull request size with labels and
  comments
- **PR Maturity**: Ratio of stable code vs changes made after PR publication

## Metrics Explained

### DORA Metrics

#### Deployment Frequency

Measures how often your team deploys code to production. Calculated as the time
difference between consecutive releases or tags.

#### Lead Time for Change

Time from when a commit is made to when it's deployed to production. Helps
identify bottlenecks in your delivery pipeline.

### DevEx Metrics

#### PR Size

Automatically categorizes pull requests based on the total number of changes
(additions + deletions):

- **S (🔹)**: < 105 changes - Small features, bug fixes
- **M (🔸)**: 106-160 changes - Medium features, refactoring
- **L (🔶)**: 161-240 changes - Large features, significant changes
- **XL (🔥)**: > 240 changes - Major refactoring, multiple features

**Benefits:**

- Encourages smaller, more reviewable PRs
- Provides visibility into PR complexity
- Helps with review planning and resource allocation
- Supports better development practices

**Filtering Options:**

- `files-to-ignore`: Skip files that don't impact complexity (e.g., `*.md`,
  `package-lock.json`)
- `ignore-line-deletions`: Focus only on additions when appropriate
- `ignore-file-deletions`: Exclude deleted files from size calculation

#### PR Maturity

Measures the stability of code when a pull request is initially published by
calculating the ratio between stable changes (initial commit) and total changes
added after publication.

**Calculation:**

- **Maturity Ratio**: `stable_changes / total_changes`
- **Maturity Percentage**: Ratio converted to percentage (0-100%)

**Maturity Levels:**

- **⭐ Elite (>88%)**: Highest stability, minimal changes after publication
- **✅ Good (81-87%)**: Strong stability with minor adjustments
- **⚖️ Fair (75-80%)**: Moderate stability, some adjustments needed
- **🎯 Needs Focus (<75%)**: Significant changes after publication

**Benefits:**

- Encourages better preparation before PR publication
- Identifies patterns of incomplete or rushed development
- Helps teams improve their development workflow
- Provides insights into code quality and review processes

**Use Cases:**

- Track improvement in development practices over time
- Identify developers who might need additional support
- Measure the effectiveness of code review processes
- Monitor the stability of feature development

## How It Works

1. **Data Source Detection**: The action first looks for GitHub releases, then
   falls back to tags if no releases are found
1. **Release Analysis**: Compares the latest and previous releases/tags to
   calculate deployment frequency
1. **Commit Analysis**: Examines all commits between releases to calculate lead
   time metrics
1. **Output Generation**: Creates JSON file, sets GitHub Actions outputs, and
   generates markdown summary
1. **Optional Commit**: Can commit the metrics file back to the repository for
   tracking over time

## Output Format

The action generates a comprehensive JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "generated_at": "2023-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "repo": "owner/repo",
  "source": "release",
  "latest": {
    "name": "v2.0.0",
    "tag": "v2.0.0",
    "sha": "abc123",
    "created_at": "2023-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "previous": {
    "name": "v1.0.0",
    "tag": "v1.0.0",
    "sha": "def456",
    "created_at": "2022-12-25T12:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "metrics": {
    "deployment_frequency_days": 7,
    "lead_time_for_change": {
      "commit_count": 15,
      "avg_hours": 24.5,
      "oldest_hours": 72.0,
      "newest_hours": 2.5,
      "oldest_commit_sha": "old123",
      "newest_commit_sha": "new456",
      "newest_excludes_merges": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Migration Guide

### Upgrading from v1 to v2

Version 2.0.0 introduces a **breaking change** in how metrics are enabled. The
high-level `enable-dora-metrics` and `enable-devex-metrics` inputs have been
replaced with individual metric toggles.

#### v1.x Configuration

```yaml
- uses: xavius-rb/agile-metrics-action@v1
  with:
    enable-dora-metrics: 'true'
    enable-devex-metrics: 'true'
```

#### v2.x Configuration

```yaml
- uses: xavius-rb/agile-metrics-action@v2
  with:
    deployment-frequency: 'true'
    lead-time: 'true'
    pr-size: 'true'
    pr-maturity: 'true'
```

**Key Changes:**

1. `enable-dora-metrics: 'true'` → `deployment-frequency: 'true'` +
   `lead-time: 'true'`
1. `enable-devex-metrics: 'true'` → `pr-size: 'true'` + `pr-maturity: 'true'`
1. By default, **all metrics are now disabled** (changed from v1 where DORA
   metrics were enabled by default)
1. You must explicitly enable each metric you want to collect

**Benefits:**

1. Fine-grained control over which metrics to collect
1. Reduced API calls and processing time when you only need specific metrics
1. More flexible for different use cases and workflows
